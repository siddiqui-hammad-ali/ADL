    disc: "ZILAL (A Blissful Shade). A modern interpretation of the traditional Hejazi architecture. Elements such as courtyards, mashrabiyas and overhangs are studied and reinterpreted to adapt to the environmental factors. The primary architectural goal was to seamlessly integrate the landscape throughout the house. In contrast to the traditional approach of a front garden and recessed building mass, the building is surrounded with landscape to create features ranging from intimate seating areas to larger landscape elements. The landscape creates opportunities for views and uses for the family throughout the layout. The orientation of the building takes advantage of indirect sunlight. Whereas direct sun exposure is addressed architecturally by creating overhangs and louvres. This provides privacy as well as helps with passive cooling of the house thus reducing the reliance on air conditioning.",
